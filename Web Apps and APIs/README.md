#JumpTheQueue

**Target persona** 

- People shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic

- Demographics – anyone who has a smart device, especially, in the age group of 15-55

As we all know, the pandemic lead to a new normal, therefore, we all have to adjust to the new settings and practice COVID safe measures. One such measure is the social distancing rule of 1.5m.

Since the beginning of the year, we have all being trying to adhere to these measures. However, there are certain situations which could lead to a potential violation of these measures. E.g. the checkout queues at the supermarkets. Therefore, I have developed the app ‘JumpTheQueue’ in order to make it easier for shoppers to do their shopping whilst avoiding the checkout queue.

The app is a simple to use interface where the shopper can scan in the item barcode, adding the product to the shopping list and finally providing a payment option to self-checkout through the app. This will help to drastically reduce the number of people queuing at the checkout counters. At the same time, this will provide safety and less traffic for the older community when accessing the supermarket’s conventional checkout services.

**Areas for improvement**

1.Inventory management - The app needs to be modified in the future to connect with the supermarkets inventory management system. In that way, the supermarkets are aware as to when they need to restock the shelves

2.Security and integrity – The app need to be modified to account for an additional layer of security due to the nature of sensitive data being captured. E.g. debit/credit card details. At the same time an additional layer of security needs to be added from the perspective of supermarkets to prevent customers engaging in fraudulent activities.

3.System to connect with the supermarkets’ loyalty programs – Incorporation of supermarkets’ loyalty programs via the app enables the supermarkets to continue their loyalty programs. At the same time, enable the customers to scan in their loyalty card at the end of each transaction to gain rewards points or other promotions.
